<p>今天在家和 tiger 玩時哼著哼著突然就想起來了。<br />當初是兔子傳給我的，我那時也超迷這首歌...整天都在唱。</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every time I think of you<br />I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue<br />It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find<br />Living a life that I can't leave behind<br />There's no sense in telling me<br />The wisdom of a fool won't set you free<br />But that's the way that it goes<br />And it's what nobody knows<br />And every day my confusion grows<br />Every time I see you falling<br />I get down on my knees and pray<br />I'm waiting for that final moment<br />You'll say the words that I can't say<br />I feel fine and I feel good<br />I feel like I never should<br />Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say<br />Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday<br />I'm not sure what this could mean<br />I don't think you're what you seem<br />I do admit to myself<br />That if I hurt someone else<br />Then we'd never see just what we're meant to be<br />Every time I see you falling<br />I get down on my knees and pray<br />I'm waiting for that final moment<br />You'll say the words that I cant say</p>
