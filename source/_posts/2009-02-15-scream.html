<p><p><strong>Lyrics to Scream</strong> :<br />
The day a door is closed<br />
The echoes fill your soul<br />
They won't say which way to go<br />
Just trust your heart<br />
<br />
To find you're here for<br />
Open another door<br />
But i'm not sure anymore<br />
It's just so hard<br />
<br />
Voices in my head<br />
Tell me they know best<br />
Got me on the edge<br />
they're pushin', pushin',<br />
they're pushin'<br />
I know they've got a plan<br />
But the balls in my hands<br />
This time its man-to-man,<br />
I'm driving, fighting inside<br />
<br />
A world that's upside down<br />
Spinning faster<br />
What do I do now? Without you<br />
<br />
I don't know, where to go, what's the right team?<br />
I want my own thing. So bad I'm gonna Scream!<br />
I can't choose, so confused! What's it all mean?<br />
I want my own dream. So bad I'm gonna Scream!<br />
<br />
I'm kickin' down the walls<br />
I gotta make 'em fall<br />
Just break through them all<br />
I'm punchin', crashin', I'm gonna<br />
Fight to find myself<br />
Me and no one else<br />
Which way? I can't tell,<br />
I'm searchin', searchin', can't find the<br />
Road that I should take<br />
I should! turn right or left is<br />
It's like nothing works without you<br />
<br />
I don't know, where to go, what's the right team?<br />
I want my own thing. So bad I'm gonna Scream!<br />
I can't choose, so confused! What's it all mean?<br />
I want my own dream. So bad I'm gonna Scream!<br />
<br />
Yeah, the clock's running down,<br />
hear the crowd gettin' loud!<br />
I'm consumed by the sound!<br />
Is it her? Is it love?<br />
Can the music ever be enough?<br />
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out!<br />
You can do it, you can do it!<br />
<br />
I don't know, where to go, what's the right team?<br />
I want my own thing. So bad I'm gonna Scream!<br />
I can't choose, so confused! What's it all mean?<br />
I want my own dream. So bad I'm gonna Scream!<br />
<br />
I don't know, where to go, what's the right team?<br />
I want my own thing. I want my own thing!<br />
I can't choose, so confused! What's it all mean?<br />
I want my own dream. So bad I'm gonna Scream!</p>
